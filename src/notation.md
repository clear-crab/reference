# Notation

## Grammar

The following notations are used by the *Lexer* and *Syntax* grammar snippets:

| Notation          | Examples                      | Meaning                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| CAPITAL           | KW_IF, INTEGER_LITERAL        | A token produced by the lexer             |
| _ItalicCamelCase_ | _LetStatement_, _Item_        | A syntactical production                  |
| `string`          | `x`, `while`, `*`             | The exact character(s)                    |
| x<sup>?</sup>     | `pub`<sup>?</sup>             | An optional item                          |
| x<sup>\*</sup>    | _OuterAttribute_<sup>\*</sup> | 0 or more of x                            |
| x<sup>+</sup>     |  _MacroMatch_<sup>+</sup>     | 1 or more of x                            |
| x<sup>a..b</sup>  | HEX_DIGIT<sup>1..6</sup>      | a to b repetitions of x                   |
| Rule1 Rule2       | `fn` _Name_ _Parameters_      | Sequence of rules in order                |
| \|                | `u8` \| `u16`, Block \| Item  | Either one or another                     |
| \[ ]               | \[`b` `B`]                     | Any of the characters listed              |
| \[ - ]             | \[`a`-`z`]                     | Any of the characters in the range        |
| ~\[ ]              | ~\[`b` `B`]                    | Any characters, except those listed       |
| ~`string`         | ~`\n`, ~`*/`                  | Any characters, except this sequence      |
| ( )               | (`,` _Parameter_)<sup>?</sup> | Groups items                              |
| U+xxxx            | U+0060                        | A single unicode character                |
| \<text\>          | \<any ASCII char except CR\>  | An English description of what should be matched |
| Rule <sub>suffix</sub> | IDENTIFIER_OR_KEYWORD <sub>_except `crate`_</sub> | A modification to the previous rule |

Sequences have a higher precedence than `|` alternation.

## String table productions

Some rules in the grammar &mdash; notably [unary operators], [binary
operators], and [keywords] &mdash; are given in a simplified form: as a listing
of printable strings. These cases form a subset of the rules regarding the
[token][tokens] rule, and are assumed to be the result of a lexical-analysis
phase feeding the parser, driven by a <abbr title="Deterministic Finite
Automaton">DFA</abbr>, operating over the disjunction of all such string table
entries.

When such a string in `monospace` font occurs inside the grammar,
it is an implicit reference to a single member of such a string table
production. See [tokens] for more information.

## Railroad visualizations

Below each grammar block is a button to toggle the display of a [railroad diagram]. A square element is a non-terminal rule, and a rounded rectangle is a terminal.

## Common productions

The following are common definitions used in the grammar.

r[input.syntax]
```grammar,lexer
@root CHAR -> <a Unicode scalar value>

NUL -> U+0000

TAB -> U+0009

LF -> U+000A

CR -> U+000D
```

[keywords]: keywords.md
[tokens]: tokens.md
[unary operators]: expressions/operator-expr.md#borrow-operators
